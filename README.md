# ZenefitsTerminator
Data pipeline and bot to bulk terminate employees from the Zenefits Payroll App. Since this feature has not been developed by the company, I had to terminate 700+ employees one by one. Thus, I built an automated program to do this for me using Google Sheets API and Selenium Webdriver in Python.

Disclaimer: No one of these terminated employees was actually laid off. This is merely the consequence of a reorganization in the payroll structure between two different parts of a hybrid company. Happily, nobody's jobs was affected by this program.
